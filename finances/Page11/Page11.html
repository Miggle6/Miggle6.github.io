<h1>The Price Chart</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Many investors analyze stocks based on their fundamentals – such as their revenue, valuation or industry trends – but fundamental
  factors aren't always reflected in the market price. Technical analysis seeks to predict price movements by examining historical
  data, mainly price and volume.</p>

<h3>Technical Analysis/Patterns</h3>
<p>Technical analysis employs three approaches for identifying changes in market moods over time: <b>trend</b>, <b>signal</b> and <b>resistance</b> analysis.</p>
<p><b>Trend analysis</b> assumes that past market behavior can be extrapolated into the future and that the trends of the past will repeat or persist in the future.</p>
<p><b>Signal analysis</b> may supplement trend analysis by assisting analysts to identify when the market will break out of a trend that it has followed in the recent
  past by identifying price-movement patterns.</p>
<p><b>Resistance analysis</b> is similar to signal analysis, except that it views the break points in terms of price limits beyond which the market is unlikely to move.</p>
