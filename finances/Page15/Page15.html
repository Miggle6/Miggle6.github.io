<h1>Summary</h1>

<h3>Purchasing Strategy.</h3>
<p>Our purchasing strategy involves finding high quality stocks with a high dividend yield and dividend yield growth. For a list of high quality dividend yielding stocks, see the
  <a href="https://www.dividendgrowthinvestingandretirement.com/canadian-dividend-all-star-list/" target="_blank">Canadian Dividend All-Star List</a>. This
  list shows stocks which have not cut their dividend over a long period of time. The list also contains financial information about the companies. If you
  want to study the historical data for dividends of a particular stock, you can go to yahoo finance, choose a company, and select historical data.
  For instance, for the company Canadian Utilities (CU.TO), the historical data of that company's dividend yield can be found
  <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/CU.TO/history?period1=1577832362&period2=1609454762&interval=div%7Csplit&filter=div&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true" target="_blank">here</a>.
  Generally, we want to select high dividend yielding stocks with dividend yield growth with strong financials which include:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Low debt.</b> The debt/equity ratio should not be more than 50%.</li>    
    <li><b>Cash flow.</b> The cash flow of the company after taxes is at least three times the amount of interest it pays.</li>    
    <li><b>Annual earnings.</b> The annual earnings growth should be consistent, and it should be in the 5%–10% range, at a minimum.</li>    
    <li><b>Payout ratio.</b> Donʼt forget that dividends are paid from earnings, so you should be sure that dividends are a modest
      percentage of earnings (this is known as the payout ratio, earnings divided by dividends). The payout ratio should be less than
      60%  for  nearly  all  stocks  except  qualifying utilities, publicly traded partnerships, and Real Estate Investment Trusts.</li>    
    <li><b>Creditworthiness.</b> In the Standard and Poorʼs ranking system, a stock must have a minimum credit rating of BBB+ to qualify.</li>    
  </ul>

<h3>Exiting before a Recession - The Inverted Yield Curve.</h3>
<p>An inverted yield curve is a good predictor of a recession. Typically, a recession commences somewhere between 12-18 months after the yield curve inverts.
  Keep in mind that we have to be 6 months into a recession before we can call it a recession (two quarters of negative growth), so, in fact, a recession
  commences somewhere between 6-12 months after the yield curve inverts. You can see the yield curve for the United States, as well as other countries,

</p>

<h3>Reentering the Market - Stock Market Volatility.</h3>
<p>Stock market volatility is exceptionally high during a recession. Typically, the stock market will not start its trek to new highs until volatility happens
  reduced. It is sweet to enter the market during a recession, because one can purchase very good stocks for low prices. The question is, how long should we
  wait before reentering. Typically, once volatility has dropped to 40% of the peak, one could consider reentering the market. Just keep in mind, the ride
  might still be long and arduous before real gains are seen. If you have chosen high yielding stocks with strong financials, your stock will give you
  cash flow and will probably outperform the market as the market recovers. The volatility index can be found
