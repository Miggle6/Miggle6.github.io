<h3>Bonds</h3>
<p>Bonds have the advantage of being a very safe place for your investments. They are a great place to store cash during a recession. During the expansion phase of
  the economy, however, their yield (around 0.5%) is usually below the inflation rate (around 2%), meaning you lose money over time with bonds.</p>

<h3>High Growth Stocks</h3>
<p>High growth stocks are a great place to be if you want to get rich quickly. The problem is, how does one know which stocks will grow fast? There is no way to
  know this without insider information. High growth stocks usually do not give a dividend, since they invest almost all of their profits back into the 
  company to help it to grow more quickly.</p>

<h3>High Yielding Stocks</h3>
<p>High yielding stocks are a good compromise of safety and growth. Since all stocks are somewhat volatile, the dividend yield for high yielding stock is usually
  much higher than for bonds (around 5%), but their growth is not as great as good high growth stocks.</p>
