<h1>The Cash Flow Statement</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The statement of cash flows, or the cash flow statement, is a financial statement that summarizes the amount of cash and cash equivalents
  entering and leaving a company. The cash flow statement (CFS) measures how well a company manages its cash position, meaning how well the
  company generates cash to pay its debt obligations and fund its operating expenses.</p>

<h3>The Cash Flow Statement</h3>
<p>Cash flow is similar to the income statement in that it records a company's performance over a specified period of time, usually over the quarter or year.
  The difference between the two is that the income statement also takes into account some non-cash accounting items such as depreciation. The cash-flowstatement
  strips away all of this and tells you how much actual money the company has generated. Cash flow shows us how the company has performed in managing inflows
  and outflows of cash. It provides a sharper picture of the company's ability to pay bills, creditors, and finance growth.</p>

  <p>Many of the items on this statement are also found in either the income statement or the balance sheet, but here, they're arranged to highlight the
    cash generated and how it relates to reported earnings. The cash-flow statement is divided into the following parts:</p>

<p><u><b>Cash from Operations</b></u><br>
  This is cash generated from day-to-day business operations.</p>

<p><u><b>Cash from Investing</b></u><br>
  This is cash used for investing in assets, as well as the proceeds from the sale of other businesses, equipment, or other long-term assets.</p>

<p><u><b>Cash from Financing</b></u><br>
 This is cash paid or received from issuing and borrowing of funds. This section also includes dividends paid. (Although it is sometimes listed under cash from operations.)</p>

<p><u><b>Net Increase or Decrease in Cash</b></u><br>
  These are increases in cash from previous year will be written normally, and decreases in cash are typically written in (brackets).</p>

<p>Why is cash flow so important? Unlike reported earnings, there is little a company can do to manipulate their cash situation. Aside from outright fraud, this
  statement tells the whole story - you either have the cash or you don't. The cash flow statement requires just as much attention as the other statements. At
  the very least, look to see if the company is increasing cash over previous years.</p>
