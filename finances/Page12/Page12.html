<h1>A Stock Purchasing Strategy</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There should be some way to have a simple investment program that makes sense, thatʼs easy to implement, and that has a high chance of succeeding
  in meeting your long-term investment goals at the end of the road. To be sure, your portfolio will go up and down—this can never be avoided if you
  hope to have reasonably good long-term gains—but the downs wonʼt bother you because youʼll understand exactly why prices have declined, youʼll
  know when prices are due to rebound, and youʼll have extremely high confidence and a clear vision that prices will rise over the long term.</p>

<h3>The Purchasing Strategy</h3>
<p>The strategy whose outlines weʼve been drawing for identifying Single Best Investment stocks does not require you to be a clever equity analyst.
  Stocks for projected high total returns merely have to fulfill the three parts of our formula: high quality + high current yield + high growth of
  yield. As Keats said of the Grecian Urn, thatʼs all we know and all we need to know. The compounding machine that you create, driven slowly but
  inexorably higher by rising dividends, will bring you solid total returns over time.</p>

<p><b><u>The Simple Formula</u></b><br>
<ul>
  <li>It's a simple formula. <b>High Total Returns = High Quality + High Current Yield + High Growth of Yield</b></li>
  <li>High quality starts  with  high  financial  strength,  and  the  ability  and   willingness to pay a rising dividend.</li>
  <li>High quality includes managementʼs honesty and managementʼs ability   to face challenges such as tough conditions or acquisitions, as well as to expand their niche.</li>
  <li>High  current  dividend  yield  is  always  relative,  but  twice  the  current    market  average  is  a  reasonable  goal.  150%  of  the  average  is  the   minimum.</li>
  <li>High growth of yield—income should rise at least as fast as inflation,    the faster the better. Past may be prologue for dividend levels,
    but projected earnings growth must support projected dividend growth.</li>
  </ul></p>

<p><b><u>Financial Strength</u></b><br>
Financial strength is the key requirement of a high-quality stock. After all, a business is a financial entity, no matter what business it is in
nor what management philosophy it uses to implement its business plan. Remember, youʼre buying a piece of a business here, one that you want to
live with for a long, long time.
<ul>
  <li><b>Low debt.</b> The debt/equity ratio should not be more than 50%.</li>    
  <li><b>Cash flow.</b> The cash flow of the company after taxes is at least three times the amount of interest it pays.</li>    
  <li><b>Annual earnings.</b> The annual earnings growth should be consistent, and it should be in the 5%–10% range, at a minimum.</li>    
  <li><b>Payout ratio.</b> Donʼt forget that dividends are paid from earnings, so you should be sure that dividends are a modest
    percentage of earnings (this is known as the payout ratio, earnings divided by dividends). The payout ratio should be less than
    60%  for  nearly  all  stocks  except  qualifying utilities, publicly traded partnerships, and Real Estate Investment Trusts.</li>    
  <li><b>Creditworthiness.</b> In the Standard and Poorʼs ranking system, a stock must have a minimum credit rating of BBB+ to qualify.</li>    
</ul>
</p>

<p><b><u>Traditional Valuation Measures</u></b><br>
The traditional valuation measures which can be helpful are: 
  <ul>
  <li>Price/sales ratio below 1.</li>
  <li>Price/earnings ratio less than the average and less than the reciprocal of the bond interest rate.</li>
  <li>Price/book value lower than the market, the lower the better.</li>
  <li>Seek cash greater this year than last year.</li>
  <li>Takeover possibility—based on financials or strategic fit.</li>
  <li>Insider activity—increased buying is more important than selling.    More relevant to small stocks than large ones.</li>
</ul>
