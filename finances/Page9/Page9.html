<h3>The Income Statement</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>An income statement is one of the three (along with balance sheet and statement of cash flows) major financial statements that reports a company's financial performance over a specific accounting period.</li>
  <li>Net Income = (Total Revenue + Gains) – (Total Expenses + Losses).</li>
  <li>Total revenue is the sum of both operating and non-operating revenues while total expenses include those incurred by primary and secondary activities.</li>
  <li>Revenues are not receipts. Revenue is earned and reported on the income statement. Receipts (cash received or paid out) are not.</li>
  <li>An income statement provides valuable insights into a company’s operations, the efficiency of its management, under-performing sectors and its performance relative to industry peers..</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Revenues and Gains </h3>
<p> The following are covered in the income statement, though its format may vary depending upon the local regulatory requirements, the diversified
  scope of the business and the associated operating activities:</p>

  <p><u><b>Operating Revenue</b></u><br>
   Revenue realized through primary activities is often referred to as operating revenue. For a company manufacturing a product, or for a wholesaler,
    distributor or retailer involved in the business of selling that product, the revenue from primary activities refers to revenue achieved from the
    sale of the product. Similarly, for a company (or its franchisees) in the business of offering services, revenue from primary activities refers
    to the revenue or fees earned in exchange of offering those services.</p>
 
    <p><u><b>Non-Operating Revenue</b></u><br>
  
  Revenues realized through secondary, non-core business activities are often referred to as non-operating recurring revenues. These revenues are
  sourced from the earnings which are outside of the purchase and sale of goods and services and may include income from interest earned on business
  capital lying in the bank, rental income from business property, income from strategic partnerships like royalty payment receipts or income from an
  advertisement display placed on business property.</p>
  
  <p><u><b>Gains</b></u><br>
  
  Also called other income, gains indicate the net money made from other activities, like the sale of long-term assets. These include the net income
  realized from one-time non-business activities, like a company selling its old transportation van, unused land, or a subsidiary company.</p>
  
  <p>Revenue should not be confused with receipts. Revenue is usually accounted for in the period when sales are made or services are delivered.
  Receipts are the cash received and are accounted for when the money is actually received. For instance, a customer may take goods/services
  from a company on 28 September, which will lead to the revenue being accounted for in the month of September. Owing to his good reputation,
  the customer may be given a 30-day payment window. It will give him time till 28 October to make the payment, which is when the receipts are
  accounted for.</p>

<h3>Expenses and Losses</h3>

<p>The cost for a business to continue operation and turn a profit is known as an expense. Some of these expenses may be written off on a tax return if they meet the IRS guidelines.</p>

<p><u><b>Primary Activity Expenses</b></u><br>
  All expenses incurred for earning the normal operating revenue linked to the primary activity of the business. They include the cost of goods
  sold (COGS), selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), depreciation or amortization, and research and development (R&D) expenses.
  Typical items that make up the list are employee wages, sales commissions, and expenses for utilities like electricity and transportation.</p>

<p><u><b>Secondary Activity Expenses</b></u><br>
  All expenses linked to non-core business activities, like interest paid on loan money.</p>

<p><u><b>Losses as Expenses</b></u><br>
All expenses that go towards a loss-making sale of long-term assets, one-time or any other unusual costs, or expenses towards lawsuits.</p>
