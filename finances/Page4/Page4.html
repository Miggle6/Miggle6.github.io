<h1>Dividend Yielding Stocks</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Mature companies usually pay out part of their profits as dividends to their stockholders. The dividend yield is usually about 1.5 times the inflation rate. The high
  yield is meant to compensate for the inherent instability of the stock market.</p>

<h3>What to look for in Dividend Stocks</h3>
<p>A few key concepts can help you find excellent dividend stocks for your portfolio.
<ul>
  <li><b>Payout ratio:</b> A stock's payout ratio is the amount of money it pays per share in dividends, divided by its earnings per
    share. In other words, this tells you what percentage of earnings a stock pays to shareholders. A reasonably low payout ratio (say
    60% or less) is a good sign that the dividend is sustainable.</li>
  <li><b>History of raises:</b> It's a very good sign when a company raises its dividend year after year, especially when it can continue
    to do so during recessions and other tough economic times like the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
  <li><b>Steady revenue and earnings growth:</b> When looking for the best dividend stocks to own for the long term, prioritize stability
    in the companies you consider. Erratic revenue (up one year, down the next) and all-over-the-board earnings can be signs of trouble.</li>
  <li><b>Durable competitive advantages:</b> This is perhaps the most important feature to look for. A durable competitive advantage can come
    in several forms, such as a proprietary technology, high barriers to entry, high customer switching costs, or a powerful brand name, just to name a few.</li>
  <li><b>High yield:</b> This is last on the list for a reason. A high yield is obviously preferable to a lower one, but only if the other four
    criteria are met. A high dividend is only as strong as the business that supports it, so compare dividend yields after you make sure the
    business is healthy and the payout is stable.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Dividend Yield and other Key Metrics</h3>
<p>Before you buy any dividend stocks, it's important to know how to evaluate them. These metrics can help you understand how much in dividends to expect,
  how safe a dividend might be, and most importantly, how to identify red flags.
<ul>
  <li><b>Dividend yield:</b> The annualized dividend, represented as a percentage of the stock price. For instance, if a company pays $1 in annualized
    dividends and the stock is $20 per share, the dividend yield would be 5%. Yield is useful as a valuation metric (by comparing a stock's current
    yield to historical levels) and to identify red flags. While a higher dividend yield is better if all things are equal, a company's ability to
    maintain the dividend payout -- and, ideally, grow it -- matters even more.</li>
  <li><b>Payout ratio:</b> The dividend as a percentage of a company's earnings. If a company earns $1 per share in net income and pays a
    $0.50-per-share dividend, its payout ratio is 50%. In general terms, the lower the payout ratio, the more sustainable a dividend should be.</li> 
  <li><b>Cash dividend payout ratio:</b> GAAP net income is not a cash measure, and various noncash expenses can cause a company's earnings and
    its actual cash flows from its operations to be significantly different from one period to the next, which can make a company's payout ratio
    inaccurate at times. The cash dividend payout ratio measures the percentage of a company's operating cash flows, minus capital expenditures,
    that it has paid in dividends. Investors can use this along with the payout ratio to get a better picture of dividend sustainability.</li>
  <li><b>Total return:</b> The increase in stock price (capital gains) plus dividends paid. For example, if you pay $10 for a stock that goes up
    $1 in value and pays investors a $0.50 dividend, that $1.50 in value you've gained is 15% in total returns.</li>
  <li><b>EPS:</b> Earnings per share. This normalizes a company's earnings to the per-share value. The best dividend stocks are companies that
    have shown the ability to regularly grow earnings per share over time, and thus raise the dividend. A history of earnings growth is often
    evidence of durable competitive advantages.</li>
  <li><b>P/E ratio:</b> Price-to-earnings ratio divides a company's share price into earnings per share. P/E ratio is a metric that can be used
    along with dividend yield to determine if a dividend stock is fairly valued.</li>
</ul></p>
