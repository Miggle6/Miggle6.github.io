<h1>High Growth Stocks</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Growth stocks are typically smaller companies who are experiencing high growth. They tend to be risky and unpredictable. Their prices will tank during a recession, and explode during
  the expansion phase of the economy.</p>

<h3>What is a Growth Stock</h3>
<p>A growth stock is a company that is expected to increase its profits (or revenue) at a much faster rate than the average business
  in its industry or the market in general. Growth stocks appeal to many investors because Wall Street often values a company based
  on a multiple of its earnings. Generally speaking, the faster that a company can grow its profits, the faster its share price should
  appreciate. Beyond profits, there are a few other common traits of successful growth stocks to look out for, such as large market
  opportunities and solid business models.</p>

<h3>Where to Look for Growth Stocks</h3>
<p>If you look at a list of high growth stocks you'll notice that many of these companies didn't exist a few decades ago but have
  since become household names. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) all started out as
  tiny players in their respective markets but steadily convinced consumers to buy from them instead of the competition. That helped
  drive huge revenue and profit growth over the years and turned these companies into winning investments.</p>

  <p>So how can you identify the next Amazon.com, Netflix, or Ulta Beauty while it is still in its infancy? One method is to comb
    through your recent habits to see if you can identify products or services that you are regularly buying from today that you
    hadn't in the past. If you (or your friends) have fallen in love with a new product or service, then there's a decent chance
    that the company behind that product is worth investigating.</p>

<h3>Societal Trends</h3>
<p>The best growth stocks tend to benefit from a massive change that happens in society. Companies that are able to capitalize on a
  trend that takes years to play out can often see their revenue and profits grow for years on end and can generate huge returns for investors.</p>

<p>So what macro trends are happening right now that investors can take advantage of? Here are a few interesting ones:
<ul>  
<li><b>Health and wellness:</b> Have you noticed that more Americans are starting to adopt a healthier lifestyle? This trend is unfolding in
  numerous ways, such as the growing popularity of yoga to the rising use of organic foods. This is a trend that looks like it is here to stay
  and is poised to benefit many different companies. From organic foods distributors, like United Natural Foods, to yoga clothing makers, like
  lululemon athletica, there are many ways that investors can take advantage of this trend.</li>
<li><b>The war on cash:</b> We have all grown accustomed to using debit and credit cards to pay for everything, so it is shocking to learn that 85% of
  global transactions still take place using cash or check. Given the benefits that come from going cashless -- faster transactions, never
  having to deal with change, the ability to earn rewards -- it seems that many consumers will switch to plastic over time.</li>
<li><b>The rise of online advertising:</b> Do you like getting cold calls? Receiving junk mail? Watching television commercial? No one does.
  That's why consumers are using caller ID, DVR, and put their names on do not call lists to limit their exposure to these daily interruptions.
  However, these realities are making it harder and harder for big companies to get their message out to new customers. That's why more of them
  are shifting their ad dollars toward online channels so they can still keep in touch with their consumers. This spending shift is creating a
  huge opportunity for companies that excel at reaching consumers online such as Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).</li>
<li><b>The graying of the U.S. population:</b> Did you know that 10,000 Americans will turn 65 every single day between 2010 and 2029? This massive
  demographic shift is a strong tailwind for all companies that cater to the needs of seniors. All kinds of businesses will benefit from this trend
  including assisted living property owners, like Welltower, and healthcare conglomerates, like Johnson & Johnson.</li>
</ul>  
  This is a just a few of the macro shifts that are taking place in our society today. The next time you notice one happening, do a little research
  to see if there are any companies that will benefit from the trend.</p>

<h3>Stock Screening Tools</h3>
<p>Other reliable sources that can be used to find growth ideas are free screening tools. While there are several stocks screeners for investors to choose
  from, a good one is called Finviz. This easy-to-use website has data on more than 7,300 companies and investors can input a variety of
  parameters to help them find stocks that fit the criteria they find most useful.</p>

<p>Here are a few traits that are regularly used to screen the market for growth stocks:
<ul>  
      <li><b>Market cap:</b> This metric is a quick way to measure a company's size. Stay away from penny stocks, and stay away from micro-cap
        companies. A good way to do this is to screen for companies that have a market cap of at least $300 million. Since most penny stocks are
        worth far less than $300 million, this is an easy way to keep them off your radar.</li>
      <li><b>Profitability:</b> Companies that are showing consistent profits tend to be much less risky than those that are burning capital. That's
        a big reason to favor growth stocks that have already crossed into the black. A quick way to screen for profitability is to set
        the P/E ratio to be a positive number. This will weed out any businesses that have not yet produced positive net income.</li>
      <li><b>Sales growth:</b> The best growth stocks are capable of growing their profits for years on end and there's no reliable way to do
        that without increasing revenue, too.</li>
      <li><b>Projected profit growth:</b> Wall Street analysts are paid huge sums to follow companies closely and publish reports that predict
        their growth rates over the next several years. While these projections can be wildly inaccurate, they are useful at gauging what
        the market expects from them.</li>
      <li><b>Sector:</b> Some sectors are harder places for investors to make money than others. One might shy away from commodity industries like basic
        materials and energy and instead focus time on sectors where businesses can build a lasting competitive advantage. Good fishing
        grounds are the technology, healthcare, services, and financial sectors. However, it's important for investors to stick with industries
        that they understand, so these sectors might not be great hunting grounds for everybody.</li>
      <li><b>Balance sheet:</b> While debt isn't always a bad thing, it's not a good idea to invest in companies that carry huge amounts of debt on their
        balance sheet. One can to use the debt-to-equity ratio to eliminate highly indebted companies from the search. This ratio
        compares the amount of total debt that a company has to its shareholder equity, which can be thought of as the net worth of the business.
        A good rule of thumb is to set the debt-to-equity ratio below 30%. However, the lower this number is, the better. But keep in mind that some
        industries naturally use more debt than others, so be careful when comparing this number to companies that are in different industries.</li>
