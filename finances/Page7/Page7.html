<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The dividend payout ratio is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, typically expressed as a percentage.</li>
  <li>Some companies pay out all their earnings to shareholders, while some only pay out a portion of their earnings. If a company pays out some
  of its earnings as dividends, the remaining portion is retained by the business. To measure the level of earnings retained, the retention ratio is calculated.</li>
  <li>Several considerations go into interpreting the dividend payout ratio, most importantly the company's level of maturity. A new, growth-oriented
  company that aims to expand, develop new products, and move into new markets would be expected to reinvest most or all of its earnings and could
  be forgiven for having a low or even zero payout ratio.</li>
