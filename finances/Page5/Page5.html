<h1>Dividend Per Share</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Dividend Per Share (DPS) is the total amount of dividends attributed to each individual share outstanding of a company. Calculating the dividend
  per share allows an investor to determine how much income from the company he or she will receive on a per-share basis. Dividends are usually a
  cash payment paid to the investors in a company, although there are other types of payment that can be received.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Dividends are payments from companies to their shareholders, usually either in the form of cash or additional stock. Cash dividends are paid on the basis
  of the number of shares you own, so if you own 100 shares you will receive 100 times as much from a dividend as someone who owns one share of the stock.
  You must own the stock before a date known as the ex-dividend date to receive the dividend.</p>

<p>When people buy stock in a company, they're usually hoping to get some financial reward in the future. Some of that may come from selling the stock at
  a higher price in the future, but in many cases some of the reward comes from a dividend paid by the stock-issuing company. A dividend is the term for
  a company returning a share of its profits to investors. A cash dividend is paid based on how many shares of the company you own, so a company might
  declare a dividend of some amount like 10 cents per share.</p>

  <h3>Dividend Per Share Formula</h3>
  <p>DPS = (total dividends paid out over a period - any special dividends)/(Common Shares Outstanding)</p>
  <p>Dividend Yield = 100% x 1/DPS</p>
