<h1>Stock Market Volatility</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is a wonderful feeling to have your investments in cash or bonds when a recession has arrived. The question remains, however, when to move cash back into stocks.
  This is very difficult, because we want to buy stocks at basement prices, but on the other hand, we have to live through tremendous volatility if we do. If we have chosen
  high quality stocks with strong financials and a high dividend yield, then we can rest easy knowing we are getting a dividend payout during this bumpy ride,
  even though their prices might dip a little while the recession lasts.</p>

<h3>Stock Market Volatility</h3>
<p>The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is a real-time market index that represents the market's expectation of 30-day forward-looking volatility.
  Derived from the price inputs of the S&P 500 index options, it provides a measure of market risk and investors' sentiments. It is also known
  by other names like "Fear Gauge" or "Fear Index." Investors, research analysts and portfolio managers look to VIX values as a way to measure
  market risk, fear and stress before they take investment decisions.</p>

<h3>Re-entering the Stock Market</h3>
<p>Economic recessions are times of high volatility. The onset of a recession can see the VIX quadruple in value over a short period of time.
  As the markets recover, volatility decreases. The question remains, how low should volatility be before re-entering the market. A general
rule of thumb is that the VIX index should drop to less than 40% of its peak before reentering the market.</p>
