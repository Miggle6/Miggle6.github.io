  be in bonds. And during low market volatility, a greater percentage of your cash should be in stocks.

<h3>What is a Bond</h3>
<p>A bond is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental).
  A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments. Bonds
  are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are
  debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to
  the bond owner and usually includes the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.</p>

<h3>The Issuers of Bond</h3>
<p>Governments (at all levels) and corporations commonly use bonds in order to borrow money. Governments need to fund roads, schools,
  dams or other infrastructure. The sudden expense of war may also demand the need to raise funds.</p>

<p>Similarly, corporations will often borrow to grow their business, to buy property and equipment, to undertake profitable projects,
  for research and development or to hire employees. The problem that large organizations run into is that they typically need far more
  money than the average bank can provide. Bonds provide a solution by allowing many individual investors to assume the role of the lender.
  Indeed, public debt markets let thousands of investors each lend a portion of the capital needed. Moreover, markets allow lenders to sell
  their bonds to other investors or to buy bonds from other individuals—long after the original issuing organization raised capital.</p>

<h3>Categories of Bonds </h3>
<p>There are four primary categories of bonds sold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by corporations and governments
  on some platforms.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Corporate bonds are issued by companies. Companies issue bonds rather than seek bank loans for debt financing in many cases because bond
    markets offer more favorable terms and lower interest rates.</li>
  <li>Municipal bonds are issued by states and municipalities. Some municipal bonds offer tax-free coupon income for investors.</li>
  <li>Government bonds such as those issued by the U.S. Treasury. Bonds issued by the Treasury with a year or less to maturity are called
    “Bills”; bonds issued with 1–10 years to maturity are called “notes”; and bonds issued with more than 10 years to maturity are called
    “bonds”. The entire category of bonds issued by a government treasury is often collectively referred to as "treasuries." Government
    bonds issued by national governments may be referred to as sovereign debt.</li>
  <li>Agency bonds are those issued by government-affiliated organizations such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.</li>
</ul>
