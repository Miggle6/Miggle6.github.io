<h1>The Inverted Yield Curve</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>You do not want to be in the market when a recession comes. It is difficult to predict the onset of a recession, since they are caused by some unforeseen event. However,
  one event has reliably predicted the onset of a recession, and that is the inverted yield curve, which is an anomaly in the bond market.</p>
<p>An inverted yield curve means interest rates have flipped on U.S. Treasurys with short-term bonds paying more than long-term bonds. It's generally regarded as a warning
  signs for the economy and the markets. A recession, if it comes at all, usually appears many months (12-18 months) after a yield curve inversion.</p>

<h3>Planning for a Recession</h3>
There are a few leading and lagging indicators when planning for a recession. A leading indicator means this happens BEFORE a recession. A lagging
indicator means this happens AFTER a recession has started. They are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>InvertedInverted Yield curve - leading</li>
  <li>US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) - leading (below 50 means contraction)</li>
  <li>Increase in unemployment (U6RATE) - lagging</li>
  <li>Decrease in wage growth - lagging</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Inverted Yield Curve</h3>
<p>A normal yield curve slopes upward, reflecting the fact that short-term interest rates are usually lower than long-term rates. That is a result of increased risk
  and liquidity premiums for long-term investments.</p>

<p>When the yield curve inverts, short-term interest rates become higher than long-term rates. This type of yield curve is the rarest of the three main curve types
  and is considered to be a predictor of economic recession. Because of the rarity of yield curve inversions, they typically draw attention from all parts of the financial world.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An inverted yield curve reflects a scenario in which short-term debt instruments have higher yields than long-term instruments of the same credit risk profile.</li>
  <li>Investor preferences of liquidity and expectations of future interest rates shape the yield curve.</li>
  <li>Typically, long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds, and the yield curve slopes upward to the right.</li>
  <li>An inverted yield curve is a strong indicator of an impending recession.</li>
  <li>Because of the reliability of yield curve inversions as a leading indicator, they tend to receive significant attention in the financial press.</li>
