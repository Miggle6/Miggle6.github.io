<h1>Recession Indicators</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>You do not want to be in the market when a recession comes. It is difficult to predict the onset of a recession, since they are caused by some unforeseen event. However,
  there are many indicators that can reliably predicted the onset of a recession. Among these are the yield curve, unemployment, and consumer spending. The inverted yield 
  curve is perhaps the most reliable of these.</p>
<p>An inverted yield curve means interest rates have flipped on U.S. Treasuries with short-term bonds paying more than long-term bonds. It's generally regarded as a warning
  signs for the economy and the markets. A recession, if it comes at all, usually appears many months (12-18 months) after a yield curve inversion.
   Keep in mind that we have to be 6 months into a recession before we can call it a recession (two quarters of negative growth), so, in fact, a
   recession commences somewhere between 6-12 months after the yield curve inverts.</p>

<h3>Planning for a Recession</h3>

<p>There are a few leading, lagging and coincident indicators when planning for a recession. A leading indicator means this happens BEFORE a recession.
  A coindicent indicator means this happens just at the ONSET of a recession. A lagging indicator means this happens AFTER a recession has started. 
  They are as follows:
<ul>
  <li><b>Inverted Yield Curve (Leading)</b>: When short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates, it signals tighter credit conditions and often predicts recessions 6-18 months ahead.</li>
  <li><b>The Sahm Gap (Unemployment) (Lagging/Coincident)</b>: Measures the rise in unemployment above its recent low, reliably confirming that a recession has already started.</li>
  <li><b>Personal Consumption Expenditures (Lagging/Coincident)</b>: Tracks consumer spending, which makes up ~70% of GDP, and typically weakens only once a recession is underway.</li>
  <li><b>Building Permits (Leading):</b> Reflects future housing construction activity, usually declining months before broader economic downturns.</li>
  <li><b>Industrial Production (Coincident/Leading):</b> Captures real output of manufacturing, mining, and utilities, often turning negative just as or shortly before a recession begins.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The Inverted Yield Curve (YieldSpread)</h3>
<p>A normal yield curve slopes upward, reflecting the fact that short-term interest rates are usually lower than long-term rates. That is a result of increased risk
  and liquidity premiums for long-term investments.</p>

<p>When the yield curve inverts, short-term interest rates become higher than long-term rates. This type of yield curve is the rarest of the three main curve types
  and is considered to be a predictor of economic recession. Because of the rarity of yield curve inversions, they typically draw attention from all parts of the financial world.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An inverted yield curve reflects a scenario in which short-term debt instruments have higher yields than long-term instruments of the same credit risk profile.</li>
  <li>Investor preferences of liquidity and expectations of future interest rates shape the yield curve.</li>
  <li>Typically, long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds, and the yield curve slopes upward to the right.</li>
  <li>An inverted yield curve is a strong indicator of an impending recession.</li>
  <li>Because of the reliability of yield curve inversions as a leading indicator, they tend to receive significant attention in the financial press.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Sahm Gap (SahmGap)</h3>

<p>The Sahm Gap measures how much the unemployment rate has risen compared to its recent low. Formally, it is defined as the three-month moving average of 
  the national unemployment rate minus the minimum value of that same three-month average over the past 12 months.
In formula form:<br>
<b>Sahm Gap=U3 unemployment (3-mo avg)-min(U3 unemployment (3-mo avg) in past 12 months)</b>
</p>

<p>When the Sahm Gap rises <b>by 0.5 percentage points or more</b>, it has historically signaled the start of a recession. For example:<br>
  If unemployment was at 3.5% (3-mo avg) and rises to 4.0%, the gap is +0.5 pp -> recession signal triggered.
</p>

<p>Unemployment is a lagging indicator, but increases tend to be sharp and sustained when a recession begins.
The Sahm Rule doesn't rely on forecasting—it detects recessions quickly in real time (faster than official NBER recession declarations, which can lag by months).
It's robust across history: it has correctly identified the onset of every U.S. recession since the 1970s without false positives.
</p>

<p>The Sahm Gap is a real-time early warning system for recessions. If the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above its 12-month low,
  history shows that a recession is almost certainly underway.</p>

<h3>Personal Consumption Expenditures (rPCE_6mAnn)</h3>

<p>Personal Consumption Expenditures is the broadest measure of U.S. consumer spending (it covers both goods and services). Consumer spending is ~70% of U.S. GDP.
When households cut back spending, it directly weakens overall economic output. Slowdowns in consumer expenditures are leading indicators.
Historically, recessions almost always feature a sharp deceleration in real consumer spending, sometimes outright declines. Consumer spending 
acts as a short-run pulse check on the health of consumers.
</p>

<p>Personal Consumption Expenditures tracks the annualized, inflation-adjusted growth in consumer spending over the last 6 months. When this 
  measure slows sharply or turns negative, it is a strong predictor that a recession is either beginning or already underway, since it directly 
  reflects weakening consumer demand — the core driver of the U.S. economy.
</p>

<h3> Building Permits (BuildingPermits_YoY)</h3>

<p>Building Permits are the number of permits issued for new private housing units (single-family and multi-family), tracked monthly by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The Year-over-Year change is the percentage change compared to the same month one year earlier. It measures the annual growth (or decline) in new housing 
construction activity:<br>
<b>BuildingPermits_YoY = 100%x(Permits this month - Permits same month last year)/(Permits last year)</b>
</p>

<p>Housing is extremely interest-rate sensitive (mortgage costs). When borrowing costs rise or consumer confidence falls, building permits are one 
  of the first things to decline. A fall in permits means fewer future housing starts which means less demand for construction labor, materials, 
  appliances, and financing. This cascades across the economy (construction, manufacturing, retail).</p>

<p>Before almost every postwar U.S. recession, BuildingPermits_YoY turned negative. Drops of -10% to -20% year over year have often preceded 
  recessions by 6-12 months. When BuildingPermits_YoY falls deeply negative, it's usually a sign that:
<ul>
<li>Households are stretched by higher rates or weaker income growth.</li>
<li>Businesses tied to housing anticipate less demand.</li>
<li>Banks are tightening credit conditions.</li>
</ul>
Together, these conditions often spill over into a broader economic contraction.
</p>

<p>In short, BuildingPermits_YoY is the annual growth rate in new residential building permits. Because housing is a forward-looking, 
  credit-sensitive sector, sharp declines in this measure often foreshadow recessions. It is considered one of the most reliable leading 
  indicators for a recession.
</p>

<h3>Industrial Production (IndustrialProd_YoY)</h3>

<p>Industrial Production is an index published monthly by the Federal Reserve. It measures the real output of manufacturing, mining, and 
  utilities in the U.S. economy. The Year-over-Year change is the percentage change compared to the same month one year earlier.
It captures how much U.S. industrial output is growing or shrinking compared with a year ago:<br>
<b>IndustrialProd_YoY = 100%x(INDPRO(this month) - INDPRO(same month last year))/(INDPRO last year)</b>
</p>

<p>Factories and heavy industry respond quickly to changes in demand, financing costs, and global trade. When businesses anticipate weaker 
  demand, they cut production early — making INDPRO one of the first real-economy signals to deteriorate. Industrial production can be more 
  volatile than GDP (because it excludes services, which are steadier), but those swings make it especially useful for catching early downturns.
 Before almost every U.S. recession since the 1950s, IndustrialProd_YoY turned negative.
</p>

<p>A negative IndustrialProd_YoY suggests:
<ul>
<li>Demand weakness → businesses scale back.</li>
<li>Tighter credit or higher rates → investment slows.</li>
<li>Global trade softening → exports fall.</li>
</ul>
Because industry is upstream, these declines ripple outward. Less factory output means fewer jobs which means lower incomes and weaker consumption.
That chain reaction often means a recession is either beginning or imminent.
</p>

<h3>Probability of a Recession (12 months)</h3>

<p>Recession indicators can be used to determine the probability of a recession over the next twelve months using machine learning 
  algorithms. These algorithms combine the effects of each indicator to determine the overall probability. The results can be 
  displayed in a web-page that shows the recession probability, a features section, and a contributions section. The 
  <b>Features</b> are the economic values that the model is using:
<ol>
<li>YieldSpread: The 10y-3m Treasury spread in percentage points.</li>
<li>SahmGap: Unemployment in percentage points versus its recent 12-month low.</li>
<li>rPCE_6mAnn: The annual rise/fall of real consumer spending in percentage points over the last 6 months.</li>
<li>BuildingPermits_YoY: The annual rise/fall in housing permits in percentage points from a year ago.</li>
<li>IndustrialProd_YoY: The annual rise/fall of industrial production in percentage points from a year ago.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The <b>Contributions</b> to the final probability are simply the product of the features times a weighting factor.  
  The weights of these features in the model are as follows:<br>
Yield spread = 2.80<br>
Sahm Gap = 1.50<br>
rPCE = 1.20<br>
Building Permits = 1.00<br>
Industrial Production = 0.50<br>
</p>

<p>If <b>z</b> is the sum of the contributions, also called the <b>log-odds</b>, the model converts <b>log-odds (z)</b>
  to a probability <b>p</b> as follows:<br>
  <b>p=100%/(1+e<sup>-z</sup>)</b>
