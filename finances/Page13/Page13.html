<h1>Recession Indicators</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>You do not want to be in the market when a recession comes. It is difficult to predict the onset of a recession, since they are caused by some unforeseen event. However,
  there are many indicators that can reliably predicted the onset of a recession. Among these are the yield curve, unemployment, and consumer spending. The inverted yield 
  curve is perhaps the most reliable of these.</p>
<p>An inverted yield curve means interest rates have flipped on U.S. Treasuries with short-term bonds paying more than long-term bonds. It's generally regarded as a warning
  signs for the economy and the markets. A recession, if it comes at all, usually appears many months (12-18 months) after a yield curve inversion.
   Keep in mind that we have to be 6 months into a recession before we can call it a recession (two quarters of negative growth), so, in fact, a
   recession commences somewhere between 6-12 months after the yield curve inverts.</p>

<h3>Planning for a Recession</h3>

<p>There are a few leading, lagging and coincident indicators when planning for a recession. A leading indicator means this happens BEFORE a recession.
  A coindicent indicator means this happens just at the ONSET of a recession. A lagging indicator means this happens AFTER a recession has started. 
  They are as follows:
<ul>
  <li><b>Inverted Yield Curve (Leading)</b>: When short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates, it signals tighter credit conditions and often predicts recessions 6-18 months ahead.</li>
  <li><b>The Sahm Gap (Unemployment) (Lagging/Coincident)</b>: Measures the rise in unemployment above its recent low, reliably confirming that a recession has already started.</li>
  <li><b>Personal Consumption Expenditures (Lagging/Coincident)</b>: Tracks consumer spending, which makes up ~70% of GDP, and typically weakens only once a recession is underway.</li>
  <li><b>Building Permits (Leading):</b> Reflects future housing construction activity, usually declining months before broader economic downturns.</li>
  <li><b>Industrial Production (Coincident/Leading):</b> Captures real output of manufacturing, mining, and utilities, often turning negative just as or shortly before a recession begins.</li>
</ul>

To accurately anticipate a recession, we should add five more leading indicators. They are:
<ul>
<li><b>Credit Spreads/Corporate Bond Spreads (Leading)</b>: The difference between yields on corporate bonds (esp. BBB or high-yield) and U.S. 
  Treasuries of similar maturity. A widening spread signals rising credit risk and tighter financial conditions, often preceding recessions 
  by several months. The Baa-Treasury spread is a common choice.</li>
<li><b>Initial Jobless Claims (Leading)</b>: Weekly measure of new unemployment insurance claims. Spikes in claims tend to occur before the unemployment 
  rate rises, making this a more forward-looking labor market measure. Sharp rises usually precede recessions by 3-6 months.</li>
<li><b>ISM New Orders Index/Purchasing Managers' Surveys (Leading)</b>: Forward-looking component of the ISM Manufacturing PMI. “New Orders” often 
  contracts before overall activity, capturing demand shifts before they show up in industrial production or GDP. Below 50 suggests contraction ahead.</li>
<li><b>Consumer Expectations Index (Leading)</b>: Forward-looking sentiment measure from the University of Michigan or Conference Board surveys. 
  Consumers often reduce spending in anticipation of tougher times, showing up in expectations before actual PCE slows. A sharp drop in
  consumer expectations often precedes recessions.</li>
<li><b>Money Supply Growth, Real M2 / Liquidity Measures (Leading)</b>: Tracks the growth of real money supply (commonly M2, adjusted for inflation). 
  Historically, contractions or sharp slowdowns in real money supply growth have preceded recessions by 6-12 months. This reflects tighter 
  credit conditions and reduced liquidity available for spending and investment. In the U.S., real M2 growth turned negative well before the 
  2001, 2008, and 2020 recessions.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>The Inverted Yield Curve (YieldSpread)</h3>
<p>A normal yield curve slopes upward, reflecting the fact that short-term interest rates are usually lower than long-term rates. That is a result of increased risk
  and liquidity premiums for long-term investments.</p>

<p>When the yield curve inverts, short-term interest rates become higher than long-term rates. This type of yield curve is the rarest of the three main curve types
  and is considered to be a predictor of economic recession. Because of the rarity of yield curve inversions, they typically draw attention from all parts of the financial world.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An inverted yield curve reflects a scenario in which short-term debt instruments have higher yields than long-term instruments of the same credit risk profile.</li>
  <li>Investor preferences of liquidity and expectations of future interest rates shape the yield curve.</li>
  <li>Typically, long-term bonds have higher yields than short-term bonds, and the yield curve slopes upward to the right.</li>
  <li>An inverted yield curve is a strong indicator of an impending recession.</li>
  <li>Because of the reliability of yield curve inversions as a leading indicator, they tend to receive significant attention in the financial press.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Probability of a Recession (12 months)</h3>

<p>Recession indicators can be used to determine the probability of a recession over the next twelve months using machine learning 
  algorithms. These algorithms combine the effects of each indicator to determine the overall probability. The results can be 
  displayed in a web-page that shows the recession probability, a features section, and a contributions section. The 
  <b>Features</b> are the economic values that the model is using:
<ol>
<li>YieldSpread: The 10y-3m Treasury spread in percentage points.</li>
<li>SahmGap: Unemployment in percentage points versus its recent 12-month low.</li>
<li>rPCE_6mAnn: The annual rise/fall of real consumer spending in percentage points over the last 6 months.</li>
<li>BuildingPermits_YoY: The annual rise/fall in housing permits in percentage points from a year ago.</li>
<li>IndustrialProd_YoY: The annual rise/fall of industrial production in percentage points from a year ago.</li>
<li>CreditSpread_pp: The difference in percentage points between Moody’s Baa corporate bond yields and the 10-year Treasury yield.</li>
<li>Claims_YoY: The year-over-year percentage change in the 4-week average of initial jobless claims.</li>
<li>NewOrders_YoY: The year-over-year percentage change in manufacturers’ new orders, used as a proxy for ISM New Orders.</li>
<li>ConsExpect_YoY: The year-over-year percentage change in the consumer expectations index.</li>
<li>RealM2_YoY: The year-over-year percentage change in the inflation-adjusted M2 money supply.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The <b>Contributions</b> to the final probability are simply the product of the features times a weighting factor.  
  The weights of these features in the model have been backtested and tuned as follows:<br>
(Baseline Intercept = -3.0)<br>
Yield spread = 3.168<br>
Sahm Gap = 1.80<br>
rPCE = 1.00<br>
Building Permits = 1.20<br>
Industrial Production = 0.96<br>
Credit Spread = 0.60<br>
Initial Jobless Claims = 1.40<br>
Manufacturer's New Orders = 1.40<br>
Consumer Expectation  = 0.80<br>
M2 Money Supply = 1.20<br>
</p>

<p>If <b>z</b> is the sum of the contributions, also called the <b>log-odds</b>, the model converts <b>log-odds (z)</b>
  to a probability <b>p</b> as follows:<br>
  <b>p=100%/(1+e<sup>-z</sup>)</b>
